## Code Review by Jonathan Larsson
- Consider darkening or fattening the p-text just a bit when used in front of the light background, some people may have trouble seeing it.
- Running the site I get three error-messages in the console regarding three different fonts, like this: "The resource http://localhost:5500/Fonts/Fira_Sans/FiraSans-Medium.woff2 was preloaded using link preload but not used within a few seconds from the window's load event. Please make sure it has an appropriate `as` value and it is preloaded intentionally."
- The DOM looks good in terms of semantics!
- Consider adding a meta-description for better SEO practice.
- Maybe you could crop some images to use for mobile use to save some space?
- Nice looking CSS. Good and consistent indentations. Maybe add some comments throughout your code to make it easier to navigate.
- I'm basically just picking nits. I think the website looks really great! Great design and great execution, well done!
